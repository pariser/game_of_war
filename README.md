## Development

* Pull this project and `cd` into this folder.
* Run `$ npm install` to install dependencies.
* Run `$ nodemon bin/www` to start the server.
* Run `$ bin/solution.js` to play the Game of War.
* Default behavior is to run this on port 3000 (may conflict with other servers)

Development dependencies

* You should have a mongo instance running, with the mongo URI
  `mongodb://localhost/game-of-war` accessible to this server.
* Install [`nodemon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) if you haven't yet
  done so via `$ npm install -g nodemon`.
